# picogl

**picogl** is a lightweight, Pythonic wrapper around modern OpenGL — designed to make GPU programming simple, readable, and fun without sacrificing low-level control.

Whether you’re building interactive visualizations, scientific simulations, or high-performance games, picogl gives you a clean, high-level API to work with shaders, buffers, and pipelines — while still letting you drop down to raw OpenGL when you need it.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern OpenGL API** — Focus on shader-based rendering without legacy cruft.
- **Simple, Pythonic interface** — Write less boilerplate, get more done.
- **Full low-level access** — No “black box” abstractions; raw OpenGL calls available anytime.
- **Resource management** — Automatic cleanup of buffers, shaders, and textures.
- **Cross-platform** — Works anywhere Python and OpenGL do.
