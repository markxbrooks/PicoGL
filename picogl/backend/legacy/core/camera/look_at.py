look_at.py

This module provides a utility function for constructing a view matrix,
commonly used in 3D graphics to simulate a camera's perspective.

The `look_at` function generates a 4Ã—4 transformation matrix that positions
and orients a virtual camera in world space. It takes the camera's position,
a target point to look at, and an up direction vector to define the camera's
orientation.

Typical use cases include:
- Setting up camera views in OpenGL or other rendering engines
- Transforming world coordinates into view (camera) space
- Creating custom camera systems for simulations or games

Function:
    look_at(eye, target, up) -> np.ndarray
        Constructs a view matrix from camera position, target, and up vector.
